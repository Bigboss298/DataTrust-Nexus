## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### The Global Fake Certification Crisis

Every year, millions of fake degrees, certificates, and credentials circulate in the job market, costing organizations billions in losses and compromising trust in educational systems. Traditional verification methods are:
- **Slow**: Manual verification can take weeks
- **Costly**: Employers spend significant resources verifying credentials
- **Vulnerable**: Easy to forge physical certificates and digital PDFs
- **Centralized**: Single points of failure in verification systems
- **Inaccessible**: Difficult to verify credentials from foreign institutions

### Real-World Impact

- **$1.3 Billion** lost annually by US companies due to fake credentials
- **30% of resumes** contain false information according to studies
- **Thousands of fake doctors, nurses, and engineers** practicing with fraudulent qualifications
- **International students** face difficulties proving their credentials abroad
- **Employers waste weeks** verifying candidate qualifications manually

## ✨ What is DataTrust Nexus?

DataTrust Nexus is a **blockchain-powered credential verification platform** that provides a secure, immutable, and decentralized system for issuing, storing, and verifying academic credentials, professional certificates, and institutional records.

3. **Encryption (AES-256-GCM)**
   - Military-grade encryption
   - Protects actual credential content
   - Only authorized parties can decrypt
   - Prevents unauthorized access

4. **Access Control**
   - Granular permissions (read/verify/full)
   - Time-bound access grants
   - Complete audit trail
   - Privacy-preserving verification

5. **Decentralized Storage (IPFS)**
   - No single server to hack
   - Distributed across network
   - Content-addressed (hash-based)
   - Cannot be tampered with

### Security Guarantees

1. **Immutability**: Once a hash is recorded on blockchain, it cannot be changed
2. **Cryptographic Integrity**: SHA-256 ensures any modification is detected
3. **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
4. **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly verifiable
5. **Privacy**: Actual credential content is encrypted and stored off-chain
6. **Access Control**: Granular permissions for who can access what
7. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all actions

## 🔐 Compliance & Security

All logic complies with:

- **ISO 27001** — Secure data management
- **NIST SP 800-53** — Encryption, access control, and audit standards
- **GDPR/NDPR** — Data privacy regulations
- **SOC 2 Type II** — Security controls and processes
- **HIPAA** — Healthcare data protection (for medical credentials)

### Security Implementation

- **AES-256-GCM** for file encryption at rest
- **RSA-OAEP** for key encryption and exchange
- **SHA-256** for cryptographic hashing
- **On-chain immutable audit logs**
- **Time-bound access permissions**
- **Wallet-based authentication**
- **Zero-knowledge verification** (verify without revealing data)

**Key Design Decisions:**

✅ **NO Database** - All data stored on-chain (blockchain is source of truth)  
✅ **NO The Graph** - Direct BlockDAG RPC queries leveraging DAG speed  
✅ **Pure Decentralization** - No external indexing dependencies  
✅ **BlockDAG Performance** - Utilizes DAG parallel processing for fast queries

## ⚡ Why BlockDAG is Revolutionary for Credential Verification

### The BlockDAG Advantage

DataTrust Nexus is built on **BlockDAG** (Block Directed Acyclic Graph), not traditional blockchain. This is a game-changing distinction that gives us unique advantages:

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **.NET 8 SDK**
- **MetaMask** browser extension
- **BlockDAG wallet** with testnet funds
- **Solidity** development environment (Hardhat)
- **(Optional)** IPFS node (or Pinata account)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd VeriDAG
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contracts to BlockDAG

```bash
cd Smart-Contract

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to BlockDAG Testnet
npm run deploy:testnet

# ✅ Save the 4 contract addresses from output
```

**Contracts Deployed:**
- InstitutionRegistry
- DataVaultContract
- AccessControlContract
- AuditTrailContract

See [Smart-Contract/README.md](Smart-Contract/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Set Up Backend

```bash
cd Backend

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Update appsettings.json with:
# - BlockDAG RPC URL (already configured)
# - Your 4 contract addresses from step 2
# - IPFS configuration (optional)

# Generate server wallet (for signing blockchain transactions)
node generate-server-wallet.js

# Copy the generated private key to appsettings.Development.json
# Add under "Blockchain": { "ServerPrivateKey": "your_key_here" }

# Run API (No database needed!)
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

**Note:** No database setup required - all data stored on BlockDAG blockchain!

**Important:** You need to configure a server wallet to sign blockchain transactions. See [Backend/SERVER-WALLET-SETUP.md](Backend/SERVER-WALLET-SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

See [Backend/README.md](Backend/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### 4. Set Up Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file (copy from .env.example)
# Update API URL and contract addresses

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for detailed instructions.

## 🔄 Integration Flow

### 1. Institution Registration

```
User → Connect Wallet → Register Institution → Blockchain Record
```

### 2. Data Upload

```
Select File → Encrypt (AES-256) → Upload to IPFS → Store Hash on Blockchain
```

### 3. Grant Access

```
Select Record → Enter Grantee Wallet → Set Permissions → Record on Blockchain → Update Database
```

### 4. Verify Data

```
Enter Record ID → Provide Hash → Compare with On-Chain Hash → Display Result
```

### 5. Audit Trail

```
All Actions → Logged to Database → Also Recorded on Blockchain → Queryable & Exportable
```
